When we consider that a breach of this acceptable use policy has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate.

Failure to comply with this acceptable use policy constitutes a material breach of our Platform Terms and Conditions ([https://aero.bid/docs/terms](https://aero.bid/docs/terms)) upon which you are permitted to use our Platform, and may result in our taking all or any of the following actions:
