### 1. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE

Our Platform is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

It is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.

We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance. 

Data protection law requires ACOM, as controller for your data:

* to process your data in a lawful, fair and transparent way;
* to only collect your data for explicit and legitimate purposes;
* to only collect data that is relevant, and limited to the purpose(s) we have told you about;
* to ensure that your data is accurate and up to date;
* to ensure that your data is only kept as long as necessary for the purpose(s) we have told you about;
* to ensure that appropriate security measures are used to protect your data.

#### Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes

We keep our privacy policy under regular review. This version was last updated on the date at the top of this document. Historic versions can be obtained by contacting us.

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. We may ask you to confirm updates to your personal data from time to time but please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us in the meantime. Please inform the data privacy manager of any changes in your data at the following email address: privacy@aero.bid.

#### Third-party links

Our Platform may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. 

We and organisations connected with us have a social media presence for the purpose of engaging with you. 

If you enable such connections or choose to communicate your personal data to us via third-party websites or social media, please remember that we do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website or interact with us on social media, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website or forum that you visit or use. 


### 2. THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together follows:

* **Identity Data** includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier.
* **Contact Data** includes address, email address and telephone numbers.
* **Transaction Data** includes details about payments to and from you and other details of services you have subscribed to.
* **Technical Data** includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website and use our Platform. 
* **Profile Data** includes your username, your account preferences and settings.  
* **Usage Data** includes information about how you use our Platform and subscription services. 
* **Marketing and Communications Data** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and your communication preferences.

Where you use our Platform on behalf of a business (e.g. an operator or broker), we anticipate that most of the data we collect in connection with your use of the Platform will be business information rather than personal data. This privacy policy applies to the extent that you provide us with any personal data ancillary to your use of the Platform for and on behalf of the business that you represent. Where you use our Platform on behalf of a business, you must not upload or otherwise transmit personal data relating to passengers, crew members or any other individuals via our Platform. If you are, have been previously, or will in future be a passenger or crew member on any flight facilitated via our Platform, we do not process your personal data. 

We refer to the above categories of data in the [Purposes for which we will use your personal data](#purposes-for-which-we-will-use-your-personal-data) tables. 

We also collect, use and share **Aggregated Data** such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does **not** directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Platform feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

We do not collect any **Special Categories of Personal Data** about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

#### If you fail to provide personal data

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to enable you to use our subscription services). In this case, we may have to cancel your subscription service but we will notify you if this is the case at the time. 


### 3. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:

* **Direct interactions.** You may give us your Identity and Contact Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you:
* subscribe to our subscription services;
* create an account on our Platform;
* request marketing to be sent to you;
* enter a competition, promotion or survey;
* upload content to our Platform;
* give us some feedback or contact us. 
* **Automated technologies or interactions.** As you interact with our website and use our Platform, we may automatically collect **Technical Data** about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. Please see our cookie policy ([https://aero.bid/legal/cookie](https://aero.bid/legal/cookie)) for further details.
* **Third parties or publicly available sources.** We may receive personal data about you from various third parties as set out below: 
* Technical Data from the following parties:
  * analytics providers such as Google Analytics based outside the UK; 
  * application monitoring and error tracking platforms which may be based outside the UK;
  * cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services based outside the UK. 
* Transaction Data from providers of technical and payment services who may be based inside or outside the UK.

### 4. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (or the business you represent).
* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to marketing in certain circumstances. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.

#### Purposes for which we will use your personal data

We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate. 

Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please [contact us](#contact-details) if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.

#### Marketing

We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. You can manage your marketing preferences or opt out of marketing at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by [contacting us](#contact-details) at any time.

#### Promotional offers from us

We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you (or the business that you represent) may want or need, or what may be of interest to you (or the business that you represent). This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you or your business (we call this marketing). 

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or subscribed to our services and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

#### Third-party marketing

We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside of ACOM for marketing purposes. 

#### Opting out

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by [contacting us](#contact-details) at any time. 

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a subscription to our service.

#### Cookies

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website or our Platform may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please visit [https://aero.bid/legal/cookie](https://aero.bid/legal/cookie)

#### Change of purpose

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please [contact us](#contact-details). 

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.


### 5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.

* Third Parties as set out in the [Glossary](#glossary).
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. 

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.


### 6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

Some of our external third parties are based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

* We may transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. 
* Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK. 

Please [contact us](#contact-details) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK. 


### 7. DATA SECURITY

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.


### 8. DATA RETENTION

#### How long will you use my personal data for?

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available on request by [contacting us](#contact-details).

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see 'Request erasure' below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 


### 9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights: 

* [Request access to your personal data](#request-access-to-your-personal-data).
* [Request correction of your personal data](#request-correction-of-your-personal-data).
* [Request erasure of your personal data](#request-erasure-of-your-personal-data).
* [Object to processing of your personal data](#object-to-processing-of-your-personal-data).
* [Request restriction of processing your personal data](#request-restriction-of-processing-of-your-personal-data).
* [Request transfer of your personal data](#request-the-transfer-of-your-personal-data).
* [Right to withdraw consent](#withdraw-consent-at-any-time).

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please [contact us](#contact-details).

#### No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

#### What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

#### Time limit to respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 


### 10. GLOSSARY

#### **LAWFUL BASIS**

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by [contacting us](#contact-details).

**Performance of Contract** means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

**Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation** means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.

#### **THIRD PARTIES**

* Service providers acting as processors based both inside and outside the UK who provide IT and system administration services (including cloud computing services, analytics services, application monitoring and error tracking) and payment processing services.
* Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the UK who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.
* HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the UK who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

#### **YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

You have the right to:

#### **Request access** to your personal data:

Also commonly known as a "data subject access request", this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

#### **Request correction** of your personal data:

This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

#### **Request erasure** of your personal data:

This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 

#### **Object to processing** of your personal data:

Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

#### **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data:

This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 

#### **Request the transfer** of your personal data:

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 

#### **Withdraw consent at any time**:

Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
