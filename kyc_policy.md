### AML & KYC Legal basis - Processing personal data

At ACOM Aviation Ltd (**We**), we uphold a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering and terrorism financing, prioritizing the highest standards of openness, integrity, and accountability. We are dedicated to conducting business solely with reputable counterparties whose funds originate from legitimate sources and are not subject to any imposed sanctions.

This includes monitoring and reporting any suspicious activities that may arise during the onboarding and due diligence process.
2. Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR): Personal Data is processed to fulfill requirements for preventing money laundering, financing terrorism, corruption, bribery, and fraud. This allows us to establish ourselves as a legitimate, reliable, and reputable business to both our counterparties and relevant authorities. We conduct necessary due diligence to safeguard our operations and protect against potential risks associated with financial crimes.
