**PLEASE READ THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PLATFORM**

### Payout Methods

ACOM Aviation Ltd (**We**) offers electronic card payouts to return funds to customers. We can only process payouts to the same card number that the original payment was made from due to payment network rules.

### Payout Approval

We must be review and approve all payouts before funds are released. We reserve the right to decline payout requests in situations such as:

- Suspected fraud or suspicious activity related to the cardholder account
- Required compliance documentation not provided by the cardholder
- Violations of applicable regulations or our terms of service

### Payout Process

Once a payout is approved, the cardholder will receive an email confirmation with the amount to be refunded and the expected timeline. This will be sent prior to the funds being released, in line with our terms and conditions.

The cardholder must review and verify the refund amount before processing the payout. This provides an additional opportunity to confirm that the return is accurate.

After the cardholder approves the refund amount by replying to the confirmation email, the funds will be returned (minus any fees) to the original card used for payment within one business day.

The cardholder will receive a second email confirmation with details of the payout once it has been processed through the payment network.

### Unsuccessful Payouts

In some cases, we may attempt a payout that gets rejected by the receiving institution. This could happen if the card number is no longer valid. In these situations, we will make reasonable attempts to contact the cardholder to get updated payment information before trying the payout again.

### Disputes

Cardholders have the right to dispute a payout they believe to be unauthorised or inaccurate. We will investigate reported issues and work to resolve disputes directly with the cardholder within a reasonable timeframe.

### Policy Updates

We reserve the right to update or modify this Card Payment Policy at any time. The most current version of the policy will be posted on our website or communicated to customers as necessary.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, don't hesitate to contact our customer support team.
