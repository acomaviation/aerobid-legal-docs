**PLEASE READ THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PLATFORM**

1. Purpose This Card Payment Policy outlines the terms and conditions for accepting card payments from customers at ACOM Aviation Ltd(**We**). By making a payment using a credit/debit card or any other accepted card type, customers agree to comply with this policy.

2. Accepted Cards and Compliance ACOM Aviation accepts card payments from the following card types in the Eurozone.
   - Visa
   - Mastercard
   - American Express

Our payment processes are PSD2 compliant, providing enhanced security for online transactions. Additionally, ACOM Aviation is PCI DSS compliant, ensuring the protection of cardholder data during payment processing.

3. Payment Process: All payments are made online via a secure pay link sent directly to the consumer. Upon successful payment, a payment confirmation will be sent to the customer.

4. Declined Payments: If card payment is declined, we suggest the end users contact their bank first to try and resolve the issue. Once the issue is addressed, ACOM Aviation can reissue a payment link for the customer to complete the transaction.

5. Alternative Payment Methods: In the event that card payments continue to be unsuccessful, we recommend the following alternative payment methods:

   - Bank Transfer
   - Open Banking
   - Cryptocurrency
   - Apple Pay
   - Google Pay

6. AML and KYC Compliance we comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. We reserve the right to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification before payment is received. However, recognising that time is of the essence in aviation transactions, we may accept payment before KYC completion,
   though this is different from our standard practice. Nevertheless, funds will not be disbursed until KYC verification is completed.

7. Use of Funds: We ensure that your funds are held separately from our working capital.

8. Policy Updates we reserve the right to update or modify this Card Payment Policy at any time. The most current version of the policy will be posted on our website or communicated to customers as necessary.

By proceeding with the payment using a card, customers acknowledge that they have read and understood the terms of this Card Payment Policy and agree to abide by its provisions.
